# Vanguard A/B Testing Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Vanguard Digital Experiment Analysis project! As a newly employed data analyst in the Customer Experience (CX) team at Vanguard, your primary task is to decode the performance of a recently conducted digital experiment aimed at enhancing user experience on Vanguard's online platform.

## Project Overview

Vanguard conducted an A/B test to evaluate the impact of a redesigned digital interface on user experience and process completion rates.

## Activities Performed

Data Cleaning:

- Ensured data integrity and consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 

- Explored datasets to gain insights into client behavior and experiment outcomes.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Measurement:

- Calculated conversion rates and distinguished between linear and non-linear completions.
- Average Time per Step: Analyzed the time taken by users to complete each step of the process.

Error Rate:
- Assessed the frequency of errors encountered by users during the process.

Hypothesis Testing:
-Utilized z-test proportion test to compare conversion rates and error rates between control and test groups.
- Employed Mann-Whitney test to compare average time per step between groups.

- Comparison with Total Population:
Analyzed whether the experiment samples are representative of the total client population.
Checked the composition of the sample against the characteristics of the entire population.

# Tools & Resources

- Utilized Python for data analysis and manipulation.
- Employed statistical tests for hypothesis testing.
- Leveraged Tableau for data visualization to create insightful and interactive visualizations.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of Vanguard's digital experiment. By analyzing key metrics and conducting hypothesis testing, we gained a deeper understanding of the impact of the redesigned interface on user behavior
